INTRODUCTION

One of the most amazing things about gases is that, despite wide differences in chemical properties, all the gases more or less obey the gas laws.  The gas laws deal with how gases behave with respect to pressure, volume, temperature, and amount.

Boyle's Law: The Pressure-Volume Law
Boyle's law or the pressure-volume law states that the volume of a given amount of gas held at constant temperature varies inversely with the applied pressure when the temperature and mass are constant. V is proportional to the inverse of P. Another way to describing it is saying that their products are constant.
PV = C
When pressure goes up, volume goes down. When volume goes up, pressure goes down. From the equation above, this can be derived:
P1V1 = P2V2 

Charles's Law: The Temperature-Volume Law
This law states that the volume of a given amount of gas held at constant pressure is directly proportional to the Kelvin temperature. V is proportional to T. Same as before, a constant can be put in:
V / T = C
As the volume goes up, the temperature also goes up, and vice-versa. Also same as before, initial and final volumes and temperatures under constant pressure can be calculated.
V1 / T1 = V2 / T2 

Gay-Lussac's Law: The Pressure Temperature Law
This law states that the pressure of a given amount of gas held at constant volume is directly proportional to the Kelvin temperature. P is proporitonal to T. Same as before, a constant can be put in:
P / T = C
As the pressure goes up, the temperature also goes up, and vice-versa. Also same as before, initial and final volumes and temperatures under constant pressure can be calculated.
P1 / T1 = P2 / T2 

The Combined Gas Law
Now we can combine everything we have into one proportion: V is proportional to T divided by P. The volume of a given amount of gas is proportional to the ratio of its Kelvin temperature and its pressure. Same as before, a constant can be put in:
PV / T = C
As the pressure goes up, the temperature also goes up, and vice-versa. Also same as before, initial and final volumes and temperatures under constant pressure can be calculated.
P1V1 / T1 = P2V2 / T2
